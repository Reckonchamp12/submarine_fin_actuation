# Submarine Fin Actuation Optimization Using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to optimize submarine fin actuation parameters using hydrodynamic data from underwater trials and scaled fin model experiments.

üß™ Developed during a research internship at the **Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR), IIT Mandi**, this work focused on enhancing underwater dynamic stability and maneuverability using ML-driven control systems.

## üîí Data Confidentiality Notice

> The original dataset used in this project is **confidential** and cannot be shared publicly due to research and institutional policies.  
> However, the **complete ML pipeline**, including **feature engineering**, **model training**, **evaluation**, and **visualizations**, is demonstrated using synthetic data that closely mimics the real structure.

See [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) for more details.

## üìå Key Highlights

- ‚úÖ Cleaned and processed hydrodynamic data (flow velocity, fin angle, pitch, yaw, depth)
- ‚úÖ Engineered domain-specific features (`angle_diff`, `velocity_depth_ratio`)
- ‚úÖ Built and evaluated regression models using **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**
- ‚úÖ Validated model robustness through cross-validation and simulated flow conditions
- ‚úÖ Achieved simulated gains:  
  - +17% Dynamic Stability  
  - +12% Maneuverability
